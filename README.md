To play the game:
 
 - the 'new game' button automatically generates a random dungeon.
 - The 'load game' button can br used to load a map that is made by the map editor. Load the "mapEditor.xml" file.
 - the 'map editor' button opens up the map editor.
 
The map editor is divided up into two main screens. These are:
 
 - The map interface - a 3x3 grid that defines each room in relation to eachother. Clicking on it opens the Room interface.
 - The room interface - a 20x20 grid that represents the room. Controls exist to set the height of each tile, and to add objects and items.
